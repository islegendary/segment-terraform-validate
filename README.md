# Segment Terraform Docs Playground

This project is a local, interactive documentation site based on the official Segment Terraform provider documentation:

ðŸ“š Official Registry: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/segmentio/segment/latest/docs

---

## What This Project Is

This is a documentation and developer experience enhancement tool designed to replicate the layout and structure of the Segment Terraform Provider documentationâ€”while adding interactive, testable code blocks for internal use.

Each documentation page represents a resource or data source defined in the Segment Terraform provider, and contains code snippets that can be:

- **Copied** to the clipboard
- **Edited** directly in the browser
- **Validated** for HCL syntax and completeness
- **Corrected** via optional integration with OpenAI Codex

The goal is to allow developers and internal users to test, verify, and better understand Terraform examples before applying them in infrastructure code.

---

## What the Pages Should Do

Each example block within a documentation page must support the following user actions:

### Copy

- Clicking this button copies the entire code snippet to the clipboard without modification.

### Try

- Clicking this button replaces the static snippet with an editable code editor.
- Users can freely modify the snippet inline.

### Use

- Clicking this button validates the current contents of the editor.
- Validation checks include:
  - Correct use of quotation marks
  - Closed brackets, braces, and proper nesting
  - Other HCL structural requirements
- If validation passes, a success message is shown.
- If validation fails, an error message is shown clearly and accessibly.

### Fix (optional)

- Clicking this button sends the current snippet to OpenAI Codex.
- Codex attempts to correct the snippet and return valid HCL.
- The returned output replaces the contents of the editor for further use or editing.

---

## Content and Structure

- Documentation content should be stored in `.mdx` files to allow embedded interactive components.
- The layout and navigation should closely mirror the official Segment registry site, with a clear hierarchy for:
  - Resources (e.g., `segment_destination_filter`)
  - Data Sources (e.g., `segment_source`)

---

## Intended Users

This is intended for internal engineers, solution architects, or documentation maintainers who:
- Want to test Terraform examples before using them
- Need a faster, interactive alternative to copying from the static registry8. Clean Up Local Terraform Artifacts

To remove everything generated locally (including state and lock files):

For Bash / macOS / Linux:

bash

CopyEdit

rm -rf .terraform terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup .terraform.lock.hcl 

For PowerShell:

powershell

CopyEdit

Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .terraform, terraform.tfstate, terraform.tfstate.backup, .terraform.lock.hcl 
- Prefer in-browser validation and optional AI-driven fixes

---

## Notes

- This project runs locally and does not interact with live infrastructure.
- The Codex integration (Fix button) is optional and should only be enabled if an OpenAI key is configured securely.


## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
4. To check code style with ESLint:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

To enable the optional **Fix** button you must set an OpenAI API key:
```bash
export NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_KEY="sk-..."
```
